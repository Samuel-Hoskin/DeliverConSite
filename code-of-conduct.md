title: DeliverCon Code of Conduct
description: Expected behavior from participants at DeliverCon
---

Our code of conduct is based on the one in use at [UK Gov Camp](https://www.ukgovcamp.com/code-of-conduct/).

Need to report an incident? Contact the DeliverCon organisers at: info@delivercon.uk or call on at 07


We (the organisers of DeliverCon) believe that our spaces (Physical and Online) should be free from harassment, bullying and hate. 

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurotype, physical appearance, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, socio-economic status, language, religion or any other characteristic. 

Everyone who participates at DeliverCon has a responsibility to help us create a safe online space and must agree to our code of conduct. This includes all attendees, organisers, volunteers. 

Unacceptable behaviour includes (but is not limited to):
- offensive verbal comments
- deliberate intimidation, bullying, harassment 
- stalking and/or following 
- violence and/or threats of violence
- unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact 
- sharing content/links to content which is illegal, pornographic or other inappropriate material 
- sustained disruption of talks/sessions 
- other behaviour deemed inappropriate, offensive, threatening or harmful. 
- unsolicited and/or persistent messaging in private channels (e.g. twitter direct messages)
- instigating or encouraging any of the behaviours set out above is also unacceptable 

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the organisers will take action they deem appropriate, including (but not limited to) removing the participant from DeliverCon and banning them from future events. 

Organisers will drop into sessions throughout the day to check for any inappropriate behaviors, and we will ask our volunteers to do the same. 

Photography and recording

You'll be offered a blue or orange lanyard. Blue means you're okay with photos or videos of you being published on the internet. Orange means you're not. If you take photos or videos it is your responsibility to observe people's choices. The event organisers can not be held responsible if people fail to do this. So if you're wearing an orange lanyard and you see someone photographing or videoing you, please tell them to stop and delete what they've done. 

How to report an incident: 

If you believe youâ€™re experiencing unacceptable behaviour as outlined above, please contact an organiser at: info@delivercon.uk or call us on 07


Please also tell us if you observe a potentially dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines; even if the situation is not happening to you. We are here to help. 

Thank you
