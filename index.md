### What this community's for

We exist to:

  - share information about how to deliver digital projects in the public sector,
  - create the opportunity to share experiences, observed behaviours and best practice,
  - give us space to discuss and challenge how we deliver government projects and products.

Read more in the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communities/agile-delivery-community).

### Who this community's for

If you're a public sector [delivery manager](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/delivery-manager) then you've come to the right place.

You might be interested in the community if you use (or want to use) agile or waterfall methods to deliver government projects or products.

You donâ€™t have to be in a software development team to join. We have community members from policy, capability and operations.
