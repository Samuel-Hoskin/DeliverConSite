### Venue

This year we are in Cardiff thanks to *Center for Public Digital Services Wales* sponsoring the space. You will receive the exact address once you've registered. 

### Attendance

We are planning to release up to 200 tickets for the event. Watch out for announcements on cross-gov Slack. You will be able to get a ticket on [https://lu.ma/uv3fz6cv](https://lu.ma/uv3fz6cv)

### Sessions

This event will be an unconference, meaning the sessions will be pitched on the day by the attendees. If you'd like to discuss any ideas for sessions in advance, you can post in #delivercon channel on cross-gov Slack.
